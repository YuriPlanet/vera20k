# Android build

**Status: skeleton, not yet built.** The Rust entry, the Gradle project and the
manifest exist so the shape is reviewable; nothing here has been compiled for
Android, and no APK has been produced. The gap list at the bottom is what M0 has
to close.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `crates/vera20k-android/` | The cdylib: `android_main`, the working-directory fix, and the hand-off to `vera20k::entry::run_with_loop`. Body is `#![cfg(target_os = "android")]`, so desktop builds compile it empty. |
| `src/entry.rs` | Start-up shared with the desktop binary: logging, panic hook, banner, event loop, exit status. `main.rs` is now just the CLI switches plus a call into it. |
| `android/app/` | The only Gradle module: `NativeActivity`, `hasCode="false"`, no Java yet. |
| `android/app/src/main/jniLibs/` | Where `cargo ndk -o` writes `libvera20k_android.so`. Generated, git-ignored. |

The library name must stay in sync: the crate is `vera20k-android`, so the
artifact is `libvera20k_android.so`, and the manifest's
`android.app.lib_name` is `vera20k_android`.

## Building

Prerequisites: `platforms;android-36`, `build-tools;36.x`, `ndk;28.x`,
`cargo-ndk`, a JDK 17+ that `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` agree on. The Gradle wrapper
is committed, so no separate Gradle install is needed — the first `gradlew` run
downloads the distribution it pins.

```powershell
# 0. Once per checkout. AGP only auto-generates a debug keystore at
#    %USERPROFILE%\.android, and build.gradle.kts points it into the checkout
#    instead, so it has to be created here. android/.android/ is git-ignored.
keytool -genkeypair -keystore android\.android\debug.keystore `
  -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android `
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 `

# 1. Native library for one ABI. Shipping strips symbols: an unstripped Rust
#    .so is commonly 100 MB+.
#    --platform 26 is required, not cosmetic: cpal's AAudio backend links
#    -laaudio, which only exists in the NDK sysroot from API 26, and
#    cargo-ndk otherwise links at its default level (21) and fails with
#    "ld.lld: error: unable to find library -laaudio".
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a --platform 26 -o android\app\src\main\jniLibs build `
  --profile shipping -p vera20k-android --no-default-features

# 2. Package. Point android\local.properties at the SDK first:
#    sdk.dir=D\:\\Programming\\android-sdk
android\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

`x86_64` is only for the emulator; add `-t x86_64` when you need it and drop it
for releases.

## Deliberate choices

- **`NativeActivity`, not `GameActivity`.** Smallest M0. It has no IME, so text
  entry (player name, chat, passwords) is unusable until P6 chooses: switch winit
  to `android-game-activity`, or overlay a Java `EditText` and add JNI.
- **Vulkan only.** The manifest requires `android.hardware.vulkan.level 0`;
  GLES-only devices cannot install. Whether to port the existing `webgl`
  fallback to a runtime capability check is P4's call.
- **`configChanges` covers everything winit handles** so rotation and
  split-screen arrive as a resize, not an activity rebuild. Rebuilds still
  happen (locale change, process death under memory pressure) and
  `android_main` handles the reuse case by finishing instead of building a
  second event loop.
- **No updater, no `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`.** In-app updates are a Play
  violation, and asking for all-files access effectively bars Play distribution.

## What is still open

1. **A shipping build.** `--profile shipping` plus `-C strip=symbols`. The
   debug `.so` is 257 MB on disk and AGP's own stripping already cut the first
   APK to 37 MB, so the remaining gain is link time and disk more than download
   size — but debug-symbol handling is AGP's business and the size moved between
   builds (37 MB, then 75 MB), which a pinned shipping profile would settle.
2. **Retail assets (P3).** The launch reaches `Initialization complete` but no
   window content: with no game data, asset resolution falls back to the
   executable's directory (`/system/bin`) and is refused. Everything below that
   — the main menu — needs the import path from the plan's P3.
3. **Portrait, not landscape.** The manifest asks for `sensorLandscape`, but
   Android 16 ignores manifest orientation on large screens: the surface came up
   2400x3392 in portrait (log below). Rotation and a portrait-capable layout are
   P4/P6 work, not a manifest fix.
4. **No on-device error surface.** `system_dialog` has no Android branch, so a
   fatal start-up error here is only visible in `files/logs/ra2.log`. A
   `Toast`/`AlertDialog` via JNI is still open.

## Verified on this machine

- `cargo check -p vera20k -p vera20k-core -p vera20k-android` (host): passes.
- `cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a --platform 26 ... build` links `libvera20k_android.so`:
  ELF64 AArch64, `android_main` exported, all LOAD segments 0x4000-aligned, so
  NDK r28 already satisfies Android 15's 16 KB pages.
- `gradlew :app:assembleDebug` produces an installable APK:
  `org.vera20k`, versionCode 207, versionName 0.2.7 (read from `Cargo.toml`),
  minSdk 26, targetSdk 36, native-code `arm64-v8a`. `zipalign -c -P 16` reports
  the packaged `.so` at 16384-byte alignment and `apksigner verify` passes.
- **On hardware** (OnePlus/OPPO OPD2413, Android 16, API 36, Adreno 830):
  `adb install` + launch reaches `Initialization complete` with
  `Vulkan` adapter `Adreno (TM) 830`, surface `2400x3392 Rgba8UnormSrgb`,
  AAudio at 512 frames/44100 Hz, and the log at
  `/data/user/0/org.vera20k/files/logs/ra2.log` — so the data-directory,
  settings, logging, Vulkan and audio paths all work on Android.
- Toolchain used: cmdline-tools 23.0, platforms/android-36, build-tools 36.1.0,
  NDK 28.2.13676358, AGP 8.11.1, Gradle 8.13, JDK 19.

## Windows local-build gotchas

- Run Cargo from a Developer PowerShell. Without `INCLUDE`/`LIB`, `ring`'s C
  build dies with `D8050: cannot execute 'c1.dll'`.
- Point `TMP`/`TEMP` at a directory inside the checkout. The Android Clang
  driver otherwise fails `unable to make temporary file: Permission denied`
  while `ring` builds its assembly in parallel.
- Point `GRADLE_USER_HOME` inside the checkout when `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle` is
  not writable: Gradle otherwise fails with
  `Could not initialize native services … Failed to load native library
  'native-platform.dll'`.
