//! Android entry point for the VERA20k client.
//!
//! Android never runs `main`. `android.app.NativeActivity` loads the cdylib and
//! resolves `android_main` by symbol (the manifest names the library through
//! `android.app.lib_name`), so the process starts here instead. Everything
//! platform-specific that has to happen before the first window — the working
//! directory, logging, panic reporting — runs in this order and then hands over
//! to `vera20k::entry`, the same start-up the desktop binary uses.
//!
//! One process gets one `android_main` call per activity creation; the activity
//! is destroyed and recreated on rotation, a locale change or a configuration
//! change the manifest does not absorb. `EventLoop` can be built only once per
//! process (winit keeps it in a static), so a second call must not reach
//! `EventLoop::builder()` — see the guard below. Killing the process on that
//! path is deliberate for the first milestone: a stale surface is a black
//! screen, while a restart is recoverable. P5 replaces it with real
//! suspend/resume handling.
